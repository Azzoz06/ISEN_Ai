---

This is a two days workshop organize in two sections:
1. Visual Recognition and Computer Vision
2. Natural Language Processing

After this workshop, you should understand the challenges and some of the technologies needed to implement Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing into Business Applications, bringing Cognitive capabilities.  
Because two days is not enough to learn all, focus is made on implementation of Machine Learning technics within the services and tools offered on the **IBM Watson Data & AI Platform**.
